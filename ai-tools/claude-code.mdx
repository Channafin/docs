Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool. This guide will help you set up Claude Code to help you write and maintain your documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Active Claude subscription (Pro, Max, or API access)

## Setup

1. Install Claude Code globally:

  ```bash
  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

2. Navigate to your docs directory.
3. (Optional) Add the `CLAUDE.md` file below to your project.
4. Run `claude` to start.

## Create `CLAUDE.md`

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your documentation repository to train Claude Code on your specific documentation standards:

````markdown
# Mintlify documentation

## Working relationship
- You can push back on ideas-this can lead to better documentation. Cite sources and explain your reasoning when you do so
- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- NEVER lie, guess, or make up information

## Project context
- Format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Config: docs.json for navigation, theme, settings
- Components: Mintlify components

## Content strategy
- Document just enough for user success - not too much, not too little
- Prioritize accuracy and usability of information
- Make content evergreen when possible
- Search for existing information before adding new content. Avoid duplication unless it is done for a strategic reason
- Check existing patterns for consistency
- Start by making the smallest reasonable changes

## Frontmatter requirements for pages
- title: Clear, descriptive page title
- description: Concise summary for SEO/navigation

## Writing standards
- Second-person voice ("you")
- Prerequisites at start of procedural content
- Test all code examples before publishing
- Match style and formatting of existing pages
- Include both basic and advanced use cases
- Language tags on all code blocks
- Alt text on all images
- Relative paths for internal links

## Git workflow
- NEVER use --no-verify when committing
- Ask how to handle uncommitted changes before starting
- Create a new branch when no clear branch exists for changes
- Commit frequently throughout development
- NEVER skip or disable pre-commit hooks

## Do not
- Skip frontmatter on any MDX file
- Use absolute URLs for internal links
- Include untested code examples
- Make assumptions - always ask for clarification

## Troubleshooting

### Usage Policy errors

If Claude Code displays a usage policy error like this:

```
API Error: Claude Code is unable to respond to this request, which appears
to violate our Usage Policy (https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).
```

This happens when a request appears to violate Anthropic's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).

<Steps>
<Step title="Review your request">
  Check if your request contains content that might trigger policy filters:
  - Requests for harmful, illegal, or malicious content
  - Code that could be used for unauthorized access or attacks
  - Content involving deception or manipulation

  <Tip>
  If you're working on legitimate security research, penetration testing, or CTF challenges, provide clear context about the authorized nature of your work.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Rephrase your request">
  Try rephrasing your request to be more specific about your legitimate use case:

  - Instead of: "Help me bypass authentication"
  - Try: "I'm working on an authorized penetration test. Help me understand common authentication vulnerabilities for my security assessment report."

  <Note>
  Adding context about educational, defensive security, or authorized testing purposes often helps Claude understand your legitimate intent.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Start a new session">
  If the error persists:

  1. Press **Esc** twice to edit your last message
  2. Or start a new session with a rephrased request

  <Warning>
  Repeated policy violations may affect your account access. Ensure your requests comply with the [Anthropic Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup).
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Try alternative models">
  If you continue experiencing issues, try switching models:

  ```bash
  /model claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  ```

  Different model versions may have slightly different policy filtering thresholds.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Common false positives

Some legitimate documentation tasks may occasionally trigger policy filters:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Security documentation">
  When documenting security features or vulnerabilities:
  - Clearly state you're writing documentation
  - Specify the educational or defensive purpose
  - Reference that you're documenting existing, published information
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API authentication examples">
  When writing authentication code examples:
  - Use placeholder values (e.g., `YOUR_API_KEY`)
  - Clearly label examples as demonstrations
  - Include security best practices in your documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Error handling documentation">
  When documenting error scenarios:
  - Frame requests around proper error handling
  - Emphasize defensive programming practices
  - Focus on helping users prevent issues
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
